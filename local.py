Liverpool’s players stood in front of the Kop, those who had played and those who had watched, their heads shaking in disbelief, their arms draped over one another’s shoulders, as if they needed to hold on to something, anything, to make sure it was real.

In front of them, all around them, flags fluttered and scarves waved and spines tingled as Anfield sang its hymnal. The stands were still full. Barely a soul had moved. Nobody wanted to break the spell, to head out into the night. Nobody wanted the feeling to end.

In the corner, far away, Barcelona’s fans stood, too, doubtless desperate to leave, to escape, but with nowhere to go. Police procedure determines that traveling fans must stay behind until the home crowd has cleared, to reduce the risk of disturbances. It feels, at times like this, a particularly cruel form of torture.

Barcelona had suffered one of the most humiliating nights in its history, beaten, 4-0, by a Liverpool team that had lost the first leg of this Champions League semifinal by 3-0, and had arrived at this game more in hope than expectation. Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp, had asked his team’s fans to turn the evening into a “party.” He had encouraged his players that if they were to fail, they were to do so “gloriously.”

And now, after slipping to the most abject, most hollowing of defeats, now Barcelona’s fans found themselves trapped, shellshocked, forced to watch others revel in their misery, an agonizing glimpse of what they might have won, of what they thought they had.

As “You’ll Never Walk Alone” reached its key change, though, a handful picked up their scarves — or whatever they had to hand: a jersey, a banner, a Catalan flag — and held them aloft. More and more joined them, brandishing their club’s colors, or their nation’s, in defiance. Sometimes, there is nothing to do but succumb.

Barcelona’s season started, 10 long months ago, with Lionel Messi on the field at Camp Nou, a microphone in his right hand, his left slung awkwardly behind his back. Messi rarely speaks publicly. It is a tradition that Barcelona’s “first captain” gives an address on the eve of the campaign, though, at the exhibition game for the Joan Gamper trophy. That is Messi’s role this year, for the first time. So it was his job.

He had not told his teammates what he was going to say: they were expecting the usual platitudes. Instead, he made something approaching a vow. Barcelona had won a domestic double last year, he said, but fallen by the wayside in the Champions League: throwing away a three-goal lead in its quarterfinal against Roma. He and his team would do everything they could, he said, to bring that “beautiful and coveted trophy” back to Camp Nou for the first time in four years.

Though he described the Roma defeat as the “worst of all,” it is not Messi’s only regret. In an interview with Radio Catalunya this season, he picked out two years, in particular, that haunt him: 2010, when an Icelandic ash cloud and a José Mourinho-inspired defense saw Barcelona eliminated by Inter Milan; and 2012, when it found a way to lose against an injury-deprived Chelsea in the semifinals.

This was the year that Messi would lay those ghosts to rest: it was, he said, the “strawberry on the dessert.” For the first time, he willingly skipped league games so as to play in European matches; he has not played fewer minutes in La Liga in the month of April since 2013. He was saving himself, so he could save his team.

Barcelona’s season ended, effectively, on Tuesday night, in the tumult of Anfield, roaring and shaking with the ecstasy of impossibility. There is a league title already won, of course, and a Copa del Rey to add to it — no little solace at all, there; failure is always relative — but these scars will, nevertheless, take some time to heal, this defeat some time to process.

When Barcelona’s players had spoken, after their resounding 3-0 win in the first leg last week, of their respect for Liverpool, their awareness of Anfield’s fervor, it had been interpreted as magnanimity, a polite acknowledgment that there was a job to finish before the celebrations could begin.

It was not. The final moment of the first leg was a Barcelona counterattack, led by Messi, sprinting the full length of the Camp Nou field. He teed up Ousmane Dembélé for a simple finish: the fourth, the closer, the strawberry on the dessert. Dembélé missed. Virgil van Dijk punched the air. Messi collapsed on the grass. In that moment, Liverpool had its glimmer.

That was all Klopp’s team needed. The absence of the injured Roberto Firmino and, after a concussion sustained on Saturday, Mohamed Salah did not dull it. Nor did the reputation of its opponent, Barcelona’s lavish talent and its razor threat, or the scale of its task.

Liverpool tore at Barcelona: a goal ahead inside seven minutes, thanks to Divock Origi, the most accomplished team in Europe rattled and swaying and stuttering in the face of the onslaught from Liverpool’s reserve forward line.

Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal, never quite given credit for their grit and their grizzle, such is the élan of this Barcelona team, steadied things until halftime, but even they were swept aside at the start of the second: two goals in two minutes from Georginio Wijnaldum wiping out the visitors’ advantage. Anfield sensed blood.

By the time Origi scored the fourth — a brilliantly clever corner routine, orchestrated by Trent Alexander-Arnold — the goal that returns Liverpool to the Champions League final, that grants it a chance to avenge last year’s defeat to Real Madrid, all the color had drained from Messi’s face.

His eyes looked red, raw, distant, his skin ashen. No player in soccer history has turned so many games to his will, has so regularly taken control of his destiny. This, though, proved beyond even him. There was to be no moment of salvation, secured by his own hand, no deliverance, no destiny.

As the clock ticked down, as time ebbed away, he wandered the field, lost in his thoughts. His strike partner, Luis Suárez, carefully unwrapped the strapping from his wrist, tossing it aside, looking longingly toward the tunnel, edging ever closer to it. He was the first to disappear as the whistle blew, as it all ended, as a stream of Liverpool coaches and substitutes flooded past him on their way to the celebrations.

Messi followed, a moment later. He looked at the ground. He did not turn back. He said nothing as Barcelona’s coaching staff offered their condolences. Just before he disappeared from view, as Liverpool’s players poured into embraces and the stands melted, he offered the briefest, softest shake of the head, as if he, too, had not been able to believe what he had seen. Sometimes, there is nothing to do but succumb.

The task in front of Liverpool on Tuesday in the second leg of the Reds' Champions League semifinal clash against Barcelona was going to be tough enough with the services of forwards ​Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Liverpool being down 0-3 on aggregate after their loss at Camp Nou last week was a steep deficit regardless.

Then came the news that neither Salah nor Firmino would play for Liverpool against Barcelona, giving the Spanish team a significant edge in its quest to advance to the Champions League final against either Ajax or Tottenham. Still, live updates for Tuesday's match at Anfield between Liverpool and Barcelona were worth tracking. You never know.

Sure enough, Liverpool was capable of a monumental upset. The Reds stunned Barcelona with a 4-0 victory in the match, giving them a 4-3 edge on aggregate and sending them to the Champions League final. Liverpool won by a clear four goals - a margin of defeat Barcelona had not suffered since its infamous, 4-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. According to Bet365, the odds of Liverpool winning 4-0 were 50/1.

This was just the fourth time a team has overturned a 3-plus goal deficit from the first leg of a Champions League knockout tie to advance. Barcelona was also on the receiving end the last time (last season vs. Roma).

Liverpool reached its ninth European Cup/Champions League final; only Real Madrid (16), Milan (11) and Bayern Munich (10) have reached more. Liverpool is also the first English side to reach back-to-back Champions League finals since Manchester United in 2008 and '09.

Liverpool's players had their hands on their heads, seemingly unable to comprehend their achievement. One of them, James Milner, was in tears. When he wasn't punching the air, Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp stood in front of The Kop in full voice and just took it all in.

Just when Liverpool fans thought they had seen it all — the so-called "Miracle of Istanbul" in particular, but also those storied comebacks at Anfield against Saint-Etienne, Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund down the years — along came another European night that just might top them all.

The Liverpool players faced a 3-0 deficit against Barcelona from the first leg of the Champions League semifinals. They faced the great Lionel Messi, perhaps in the best form of his life. They faced fatigue from a grueling Premier League title race with Manchester City and the absence of two of the team's key forwards, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.

How to explain, then, a remarkable 4-0 win that sent Liverpool into a second straight Champions League final, 4-3 on aggregate?

"We know this club is a mix of atmosphere, emotion, desire and footballing quality," Klopp said. "For me, this club has a big heart and tonight the heart was pounding like crazy. You could feel it all over the world."

It took a goal of breathtaking quality — but also extraordinary cheek — to complete the greatest in a long line of famous comebacks by Liverpool, which is one win away from becoming European champion for a sixth time.

Euphoria had already engulfed Anfield when Liverpool, leading 3-0 and smothering Barcelona with its intensity, was awarded a corner in the 79th minute. Trent Alexander-Arnold, a 20-year-old right back, put the ball down in the quadrant and then turned around as if he was about to leave the kick to a teammate.

In an instant, he spun round again and whipped in a low cross that Barcelona's players weren't prepared for. Divock Origi was ready, though, and he swept home a finish from eight meters (yards) into the top corner for his second goal of the game.

Klopp was full of praise for the lucid thinking of Alexander-Arnold, the youngest player on the Liverpool team, and said he hadn't even seen the corner being taken.

"Incredibly smart," Klopp said, shaking his head. "Genius."

It was only the third time in the history of the competition that a team rallied from three goals down after the first leg of a semifinal and progressed to the final, after Panathinaikos in 1970-71 and Barcelona in 1985-86. No team had done it in the Champions League era.

"When you have a collapse of this nature," Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said, "we will have a few horrible days ahead."

For Barcelona, it was the second straight year that the team let a three-goal lead slip, having beaten Roma 4-1 at home in the quarterfinals in 2018 before losing the return leg 3-0 to go out.

As for Liverpool, given the opposition this display rivaled the comeback from three goals down against AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final.

There was also the 3-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the 1977 European Cup and the 4-3 win from 2-0 down against Borussia Dortmund in the 2016 Europa League quarterfinals. The last-gasp 3-1 win over Olympiakos, sealed by Steven Gerrard's late long-range goal, in the 2004-05 group stage also lingers long in the memory.

"The people from outside, they doubted us and thought we couldn't do it," said Georginio Wijnaldum, a halftime substitute who scored two of the goals. "But once again we showed that everything is possible."

Klopp had delivered a stirring speech on the eve of the game, telling his players to "fail in a beautiful way" if they were to get eliminated.

They took that to heart.

Salah, Liverpool's top scorer who missed the game as he followed protocols after a concussion, entered the stadium before kickoff wearing a T-shirt bearing the message: "Never Give Up."

Then teammate Andrew Robertson set the tone on the field, pushing Messi's head with two hands while the Barcelona forward was on the ground after an early challenge. Fabinho followed that up with a crunching tackle on Luis Suarez, who was jeered and goaded relentlessly by Liverpool fans at the ground he graced for 3½ years.

A goal was needed to really give Barcathe jitters and it arrived after seven minutes, with Origi tapping into an empty net after goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen parried a shot by Jordan Henderson.

Barcelona already appeared rattled, with Suarez living up to his role as the player opposition fans love to hate. In one incident, the striker flicked his boot back into the right knee of Robertson as they ran along together. Robertson needed treatment and was substituted at halftime, with his injury later confirmed to be a calf muscle problem.

Wijnaldum, who replaced Robertson, made an almost instant impact, making it 2-0 by sweeping home a low cross from Alexander-Arnold. Two minutes later, the Dutch midfielder made another run into the area and met a cross from Xherdan Shaqiri with a firm header into the corner past a flat-footed Ter Stegen.

The goals came in the 54th and 56th minutes — the times of Liverpool's first two goals in that 2005 final in Istanbul.

Philippe Coutinho, another former Liverpool player, was substituted for Nelson Semedo after an ineffective display and Barca quickly improved, exerting more control. Liverpool's players might also have wondered how to approach the game with the score tied on aggregate.

Then came the coup de grace after the cheeky play by Alexander-Arnold at a corner. Barcelona had no answer, with Messi — the star of the first leg with two goals — largely snuffed out.

Tottenham or Ajax await in the June 1 final in Madrid. Ajax leads 1-0 from the first leg.

Liverpool have shocked the world. Heading back to Anfield after losing a dispiriting 3-0 first leg in Barcelona, Liverpool needed something resembling a miracle to reach their second straight Champions League final. And they found one, somehow, winning 4-0 at home and booting Barcelona out of the competition in the same completely humiliating fashion that Roma did last year.

Everything leading up to the game seemed to be tilting in Barcelona’s favor, even if they were not the better team in the first leg. Liverpool were forced to play their best lineup over the weekend to beat Newcastle and stay within striking distance of Manchester City in the Premier League, losing Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in the process. Meanwhile Barcelona, who’ve already locked up the domestic title, got to rest everyone and play a lineup of relative scrubs. A single away goal would have forced Liverpool to score five, and Lionel Messi had yet again proved his ability to conjure goals from nothing.

Instead, Liverpool took over. Divock Origi, starting in place of the injured Firmino, scored in the seventh minute, and Liverpool controlled the game from the jump as Barcelona mostly seemed content to defend. Halftime sub Georginio Wijnaldum proved to be just the boost Liverpool needed, as he scored back-to-back goals in the 54th and 56th minutes to tie up the aggregate scoreline.

With over half an hour left, Liverpool still needed to prevent an away goal from forcing them to score five on the night to advance. The eventual winner came 20 minutes after Wijnaldum tied it. Trent Alexander-Arnold manufactured a corner, then caught Barcelona sleeping with an extremely cheeky delivery. The Barca defense was paying attention to Xherdan Shaqiri as he trotted to the flag, but Alexander-Arnold rushed back to the ball and slipped it to a waiting Origi. The Belgian smashed it in to close the door on Barcelona’s hopes.

Barca have now been on the positive end of greatest two-legged playoff comeback in soccer history as well as the losing end of two of the worst such comebacks. Meanwhile, Liverpool will await the winner of Ajax-Tottenham in the final in Madrid, with a chance to redeem last year’s heartbreak in the city of the team that beat them.
